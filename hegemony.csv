Musicians have complex relationships,particularly those between teachers and students and those within ensembles of various sizes. Visual artists may have similar teacher-student relationships, but typically do not create their work together. Dancers may perform together, but they are usually taught in groups. Similarly, athletes may compete in groups, but they do not usually perform in public with their coaches. For this project we will focus specifically on relationships among Renaissance musicians and how to extract the biographical and relational data automatically from existing documents using natural language processing technology, creating a model applicable to other time periods and disciplines.","To support: The continued development of a prosopographical database tracing the social and professional networks of Renaissance musicians, using automated methods to identify individuals and biographical information within relevant sources and to establish relationships between them.",,,,,,,

The current prototype, built by PI Railton and a national team of Faulkner scholars in collaboration with the digital humanities technologists at UVA, models a way to enter every character, location and event in single texts into a robust database, and map that data into an atlas of interactive visual resources. Our proposal will extend this prototype to enable inter-textual study of all the Yoknapatawpha fiction. This enlargement will deploy the exceptional capacities of digital humanities to make the study of Faulkner’s engagement with a particular place and major issues in American history as dynamic as his repeated returns to it and them. The extended design will provide students with new means to appreciate Faulkner’s art, and scholars with transformative digital pathways to research all that his work can reveal about literature and culture.",To support: The development of an expanded prototype that allows for the mapping and study of William Faulker's fiction that took place in the imaginary county of Yoknapatawpha.,,,,,,,

Working with a hand-classified collection of 4,275 English-language works, we have discovered new perspectives on the history of genre.

First, we will add to the Perseus DL the writings of Greek historians that exist only in fragmentary form. This task goes beyond simple data entry: we will create the first major digital collection of fragmentary authors designed from the start to interact with multiple source editions. Second, we will create a repository of philological data about the Greco-Roman world seeded with twenty years' worth of Perseus materials. The objects that we create will not only include books but every labeled object within each logical document. Third, we will convert the workflow that has evolved over the past ten years to process textual materials in Perseus into a grid-enabled workflow based on Web services that can be applied to and customized for many collections. Although this project will concentrate on the classics collections in the Perseus DL, the new workflows will also process non-classical Perseus content, and will thus from the start demonstrate their generality. The development process will follow a strategy already successfully employed in e-Science projects at the Imperial College Internet Centre. It will consist of conversion of the Perseus workflow and tools into a Web service environment, in which the Perseus workflow is analyzed into steps, each of which is published as a Web service with a configurable API. A workflow mirroring the Perseus workflow will then be composed and fine-tuned using model data from Perseus and sample data from the digitization within the current scope of this project.

The methods we use to create this work will let users search a text not only by word form, but also by word sense, syntactic subcategorization and selectional preference.
